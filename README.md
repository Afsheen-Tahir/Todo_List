# Todo_List

YourTodo is a Django-based task management application that allows users to efficiently manage their daily tasks. The system provides full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for todos, along with smart due-date notifications.

🔐 User Authentication: Each registered user can create, update, and view only their own tasks.

⏰ Due Date Notifications: If a task is due tomorrow, the system highlights it with a notification.

👤 Guest Mode: Unauthenticated users can also create temporary todos, but these are not stored in the database — only authenticated users’ data is saved persistently.

💾 Persistent Storage: Authenticated users’ todos are stored securely in the database with user-level isolation.

🎨 User-Friendly Interface: Simple and clean design for easy task tracking and management...
